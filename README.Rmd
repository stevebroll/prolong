# prolong

The primary purpose of `prolong` is to facilitate penalized modeling of high-dimensional longitudinal omics data with a longitduinal clinical outcome to obtain a sparse set of omics variables that co-vary with the outcome over time. `prolong` also provides functionality in both R and in a point-and-click GUI shiny app for plots that reveal the underlying correlation structure of the omics variables. For more information, visit the [package website](https://stevebroll.github.io/prolong/).
