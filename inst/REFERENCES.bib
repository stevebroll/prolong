	abstract = {This paper concerns a class of group-lasso learning problems where the objective function is the sum of an empirical loss and the group-lasso penalty. For a class of loss function satisfying a quadratic majorization condition, we derive a unified algorithm called groupwise-majorization-descent (GMD) for efficiently computing the solution paths of the corresponding group-lasso penalized learning problem. GMD allows for general design matrices, without requiring the predictors to be group-wise orthonormal. As illustration examples, we develop concrete algorithms for solving the group-lasso penalized least squares and several group-lasso penalized large margin classifiers. These group-lasso models have been implemented in an R package gglasso publicly available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gglasso. On simulated and real data, gglasso consistently outperforms the existing software for computing the group-lasso that implements either the classical groupwise descent algorithm or Nesterov’s method.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: Graphs or networks are common ways of depicting information. In biology in particular, many different biological processes are represented by graphs, such as regulatory networks or metabolic pathways. This kind of a priori information gathered over many years of biomedical research is a useful supplement to the standard numerical genomic data such as microarray gene-expression data. How to incorporate information encoded by the known biological networks or graphs into analysis of numerical data raises interesting statistical challenges. In this article, we introduce a network-constrained regularization procedure for linear regression analysis in order to incorporate the information from these graphs into an analysis of the numerical data, where the network is represented as a graph and its corresponding Laplacian matrix. We define a network-constrained penalty function that penalizes the L1-norm of the coefficients but encourages smoothness of the coefficients on the network.Results: Simulation studies indicated that the method is quite effective in identifying genes and subnetworks that are related to disease and has higher sensitivity than the commonly used procedures that do not use the pathway structure information. Application to one glioblastoma microarray gene-expression dataset identified several subnetworks on several of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) transcriptional pathways that are related to survival from glioblastoma, many of which were supported by published literatures.Conclusions: The proposed network-constrained regularization procedure efficiently utilizes the known pathway structures in identifying the relevant genes and the subnetworks that might be related to phenotype in a general regression framework. As more biological networks are identified and documented in databases, the proposed method should find more applications in identifying the subnetworks that are related to diseases and other biological processes.Contact:  hongzhe@mail.med.upenn.edu}",

ABSTRACT={Studying the association of the brain's structure and function with neurocognitive outcomes requires a comprehensive analysis that combines different sources of information from a number of brain-imaging modalities. Recently developed regularization methods provide a novel approach using information about brain structure to improve the estimation of coefficients in the linear regression models. Our proposed method, which is a special case of the Tikhonov regularization, incorporates structural connectivity derived with Diffusion Weighted Imaging and cortical distance information in the penalty term. Corresponding to previously developed methods that inform the estimation of the regression coefficients, we incorporate additional information via a Laplacian matrix based on the proximity measure on the cortical surface. Our contribution consists of constructing a principled formulation of the penalty term and testing the performance of the proposed approach via extensive simulation studies and a brain-imaging application. The penalty term is constructed as a weighted combination of structural connectivity and proximity between cortical areas. Simulation studies mimic the real brain-imaging settings. We apply our approach to the study of data collected in the Human Connectome Project, where the cortical properties of the left hemisphere are found to be associated with vocabulary comprehension.}

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.}",
