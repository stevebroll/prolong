# prolong

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The primary purpose of `prolong` is to facilitate penalized modeling of
high-dimensional longitudinal omics data with a longitduinal clinical
outcome to obtain a sparse set of omics variables that co-vary with the
outcome over time. `prolong` also provides functionality in both R and
in a point-and-click GUI shiny app for plots that reveal the underlying
correlation structure of the omics variables.

A preview of the shiny app that is being continuously updated is
availableb at the following link: [Shiny
App](https://stevebroll-cornell.shinyapps.io/TBcorr/)
